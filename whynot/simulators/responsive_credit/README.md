# Responsive Credit Simulator

This credit simulator runs a model of strategic prediction in which
an institution predicts (as a regression) the creditworthiness of loan 
applicants, and agents react to the institution's classifier by manipulating their
features to increase the likelihood that they receive a favorable classification.
This manipulation does change the true underlying label, which is an unknown noisy
linear model of the features.
